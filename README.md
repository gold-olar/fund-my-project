## Fund My Project

This is a simple web3 project I built to practice my knowledge of 
- Writing smart contracts in solidity
- Writing tests for smart contracts
- Deploying smart contracts
- Using the web3 library
- Using the ethersjs library
- Building web3 Frontend applications 


### Description

This is a sort of crowd funding platform where a project owner creates a project and random people support by donating eth. Spending requests need to be created by the project owner and the requests have to be approved by more than half of the people supporting this project. The goal of this flow of approval is to prevent fraudulent projects.
